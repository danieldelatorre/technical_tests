Task:
Write a Spring program using OOP, which when run would generate a list of voucher codes based 
on a voucher type specified in a configuration file. Configuration should be provided as a 
separate file in a format of your choice (ini/xml, etc..).

Requirements:   
While any of  generator implementations are valid, there must be at least two different 
algorithms used. It should be enough to update configuration to get a different list of voucher codes.
Example:

[vouchers]
quantity = 5
algorithm = sequentialNumbers
Output:
000001
000002
000003
000004
000005
